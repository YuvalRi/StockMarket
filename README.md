# **Stock Market**

## Project summary
In this project I created a system which simulates a stock market. The stock market composed of some companies. The system enables the user to insert and remove companies from the stock market and to make different actions.

##  About the Classes
Two classes created to implement the system idea:

1. *Company* - This class includes the required methods and represents a specific company.

2. *StockMarket* - This class represents the whole stock market which contains a list of companies.

## Tests
In order to check the correctness of all the functions in both classes, I did a tests for each function by using 'pytest' testing tool.
