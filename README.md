In this assignment I created a system which simulates a stock market. Stock Market (StockMarket) composed of some companies (Company). The system enables the user to insert and remove companies from stock market and to make different actions.

'Company' class includes required methods and represents a specific company.

'StockMarket' class represents the whole stock market that contains list of companies.

The code also contains tests for each class. The goal of these tests is to make sure that all the functions in both classes are correct and valid such that all the required actions are available. These tests done by using 'pytest'.
